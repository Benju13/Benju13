ðŸ‘‹ Howdy, My name is Benju. I am third year PhD student at Texas A&M University. I am broadly interested in forest ecology, carbon allocation and data analysis. I use techniiques such as eddy covariance and modelling to understand forest carbon dynamics. Feel free to reach me at Benju.baniya@tamu.edu
